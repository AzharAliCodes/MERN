💡 1. What is JavaScript (JS)?

JavaScript is a programming language used to make websites interactive.

✅ It runs in the browser.
✅ It controls things like buttons, forms, popups, sliders, etc.
✅ It can also be used on servers (with Node.js).

🧠 Example Use:

 Click a button → Show a message
 Type in form → Check if input is valid
 Change color or style when mouse hovers

 💡 2. What is High-Level and Low-Level Programming Language?

 🔹 High-Level Language:

 Easy to read and write
 Close to human language
 Examples: JavaScript, Python, Java

js
let name = "Ali"; // High-level code


 🔹 Low-Level Language:

 Closer to machine language
 Hard to read, but faster
 Examples: Assembly, Machine Code (Binary)

🧠 Think of it like this:
High-level is like talking in English.
Low-level is like talking in 0s and 1s.

 💡 3. What is Compiler and Interpreter?

 🔹 Compiler:

 Translates the whole code at once into machine code.
 Fast after compiling.
 Example: C, C++

 🔹 Interpreter:

 Translates code line-by-line.
 Slower but easier to debug.
 Example: JavaScript, Python

🧠 JavaScript is an interpreted language.

 💡 4. What is Single-Threaded and Multi-Threaded?

 🔹 Single-threaded:

 One task runs at a time.
 JavaScript is single-threaded.

js
console.log("Task 1");
console.log("Task 2"); // Runs after Task 1


 🔹 Multi-threaded:

 Many tasks run at the same time (parallel).
 Used in languages like Java, C++, or in background tasks.

🧠 Example: A cook (thread) can only make one dish at a time (single). If there are 3 cooks, they can make 3 dishes (multi-threaded).

 💡 5. How to Print in JavaScript?

Use console.log() to print anything in JavaScript.

js
console.log("Hello Ali");
console.log(5 + 3);


✅ Output goes to the browser console (Right-click → Inspect → Console tab).

---

 💡 6. What is a Variable in JavaScript?

A variable is like a box that stores data.

js
let name = "Ali";
let age = 20;


Here:

 name is a variable that stores "Ali"
 age is a variable that stores 20

 💡 7. Types of Variables in JS

There are three ways to declare a variable:

| Keyword | Can Reassign? | Block Scope? | Hoisted? |
| ------- | ------------- | ------------ | -------- |
| var   | ✅ Yes         | ❌ No         | ✅ Yes    |
| let   | ✅ Yes         | ✅ Yes        | ❌ No     |
| const | ❌ No          | ✅ Yes        | ❌ No     |

js
var x = 5;    // Old way
let y = 10;   // Modern way (recommended)
const z = 15; // Constant value


---

 💡 8. Rules to Declare a Variable

✅ Rules:

1. Name must start with a letter, _, or $
2. Cannot start with a number
3. Cannot use JS keywords like let, function, etc.
4. Case-sensitive (Name and name are different)
5. Use meaningful names

js
let name = "Ali";      // ✅ Good
let _score = 100;      // ✅ OK
let $total = 50;       // ✅ OK
let 1value = 10;       // ❌ Error
let let = 5;           // ❌ Error
