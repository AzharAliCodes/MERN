Animation (Meaning)

Animation in CSS means changing the style of an element step-by-step over time.

Example: A box that moves, changes color, or grows bigger without JavaScript.

  Animation Properties (Basic & Simple)

 1. animation-name
- The name of your animation (must match @keyframes).
- Example:  
  animation-name: slideRight;

---

 2. animation-duration
- How long the animation takes to complete.
- Example:  
  animation-duration: 2s; → Takes 2 seconds.

---

 3. animation-timing-function
- Speed style of the animation (same as transition):
  - ease – slow > fast > slow
  - linear – same speed all the time
  - ease-in – slow at start
  - ease-out – slow at end
  - ease-in-out – slow start and end

---

 4. animation-delay
- Wait time before animation starts.
- Example:  
  animation-delay: 1s; → Waits 1 second before starting.

---

 5. animation-iteration-count
- How many times the animation should run.
- Examples:
  - 1 → Run once
  - 3 → Run 3 times
  - infinite → Keep running forever

---

 6. animation-direction
- Which direction the animation should run:
  - normal – Start to end
  - reverse – End to start
  - alternate – First forward, then backward
  - alternate-reverse – First backward, then forward

---

 7. animation-fill-mode
- Controls what style should be kept before or after the animation runs.
- Values:
  - none – No styles stay (default)
  - forwards – Final (last) style stays
  - backwards – First style appears before animation starts
  - both – Keeps first and last styles

Difference Example:

| fill-mode | What stays visible |
|-----------|--------------------|
| forwards | Last style after animation ends |
| backwards | First style before animation begins |
| both | First + Last styles |
| none | No styles stay |

 📝 Syntax (Short-hand for animation)
css
animation: name duration timing-function delay iteration-count direction fill-mode;


✅ Example:
css
animation: slideRight 2s ease-in 1s infinite alternate forwards;

Meaning:  
- Animation name = slideRight  
- Duration = 2 seconds  
- Speed = starts slow  
- Wait = 1 second  
- Repeat = forever  
- Direction = forward and backward  
- After animation ends, last style stays

 🎬 @keyframes (The Heart of Animation)

The @keyframes rule defines what changes in your animation.

 🔹 Basic Structure:
css
@keyframes slideRight {
  from {
    transform: translateX(0);
  }
  to {
    transform: translateX(200px);
  }
}

This will move the element 200px to the right.

---

 🔹 Using Percentages

You can break it into more steps:
css
@keyframes moveAround {
  0%   { transform: translateX(0); }
  25%  { transform: translateY(100px); }
  50%  { transform: translateX(100px); }
  75%  { transform: translateY(0); }
  100% { transform: translateX(0); }
}

This moves the element in a square path: right → down → left → up.

---

 🔹 Direction Examples

- Left:
  css
  transform: translateX(-100px);
  
- Right:
  css
  transform: translateX(100px);
  
- Up:
  css
  transform: translateY(-100px);
  
- Down:
  css
  transform: translateY(100px);
