What is Responsiveness?

Responsiveness means:
 A website looks good and works well on all screen sizes — mobile, tablet, laptop, etc.

When a site is responsive, it adjusts automatically depending on the screen size.

  Explanation of @media screen and (min-width: 769px) and (max-width: 1024px):

This is a media query in CSS. Let’s break it word by word:

 @media: This starts a media query.
 screen: This targets screens (like phone, laptop, tablet).
 and: Combines multiple conditions.
 min-width: 769px: Only apply CSS if screen is at least 769px wide.
 max-width: 1024px: Only apply CSS if screen is up to 1024px wide.

 So this CSS block runs only for tablets (width between 769px and 1024px).

 What is a Breakpoint?

A breakpoint is a specific screen width (in pixels) where your layout should change to stay user-friendly.

Example:

 At 768px, a mobile view might switch to tablet view.
 At 1024px, tablet view might switch to laptop view.

Think of breakpoints as size triggers where design changes.
