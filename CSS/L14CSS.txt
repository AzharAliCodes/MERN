 Basic Transition Properties
1. transition-duration
- It controls how long the transition takes.
- Example:  
  transition-duration: 1s; ‚Üí It will take 1 second to change.

---

2. transition-timing-function
- It controls how the speed of the transition will behave during the change.
- Different types:
  - ease ‚Üí Starts slow, becomes fast, then slow at the end (default).
  - ease-in ‚Üí Starts slow, then becomes fast.
  - ease-out ‚Üí Starts fast, then becomes slow.
  - ease-in-out ‚Üí Slow at start, fast in middle, slow at end.
  - cubic-bezier() ‚Üí You can create your own speed style by adjusting the curve (you can use "Inspect Element" in browser and adjust the graph/curve).

---

3. transition-delay
- It controls how much time to wait before starting the transition.
- Example:  
  transition-delay: 0.5s; ‚Üí Wait for half a second, then start the change.

---

4. transition-property
- It controls which property you want to animate (like background-color, width, height, etc.)
- Example:  
  transition-property: background-color; ‚Üí Only color will change smoothly.

üî• Transform (Meaning)
Transform means to change the shape, size, or position of an element.

---

üéØ Basic Transform Examples

1. translateX(50px)
- Move the element 50 pixels to the right (X-axis is horizontal).
- Positive value ‚Üí move right.
- Negative value ‚Üí move left.

Example:
css
transform: translateX(50px);

(Moves right 50px)

---

2. translateY(50px)
- Move the element 50 pixels downward (Y-axis is vertical).
- Positive value ‚Üí move down.
- Negative value ‚Üí move up.

Example:
css
transform: translateY(50px);

(Moves down 50px)

---

3. Move Both X and Y Together
css
transform: translate(50px, 50px);

Meaning:  
- Move right 50px (X-axis),
- Move down 50px (Y-axis) at the same time.

---

üåÄ Other Types of Transform
Rotate
- Rotate the element.
- Example:
  css
  transform: rotate(45deg);
  
  ‚Üí Rotates 45 degrees clockwise.

---

Skew
- Tilt the element in X or Y direction.
- Example:
  css
  transform: skew(20deg, 10deg);
  
  ‚Üí Tilts sideways (X: 20deg, Y: 10deg).

---

Scale
- Make the element bigger or smaller.
- Example:
  css
  transform: scale(1.5);
  
  ‚Üí 1.5 times bigger.

---

Perspective
- Used for 3D effects (like looking at a box in 3D).

‚ö° 2D and 3D Transform

| 2D Transform | 3D Transform |
|:---|:---|
| Works on X and Y axes (left-right, up-down). | Works on X, Y, and Z axes (left-right, up-down, and closer/farther). |
| Example: rotate(45deg) | Example: rotateX(45deg), rotateY(45deg), rotateZ(45deg) |
