 ✅ 1. Component-Based Architecture

 🔹 What is it?

React builds the UI using independent, reusable components like LEGO blocks.

Each component manages its own structure and logic.

 ✅ Example:

jsx
function Header() {
  return <h1>Welcome to My App</h1>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <p>This is the main content.</p>
    </div>
  );
}


> 🧠 Why?
> This makes code modular, easier to test, and reusable.

---

 ✅ 2. Virtual DOM

 🔹 What is it?

React uses a virtual representation of the actual DOM. When something changes, React updates only that part of the DOM efficiently.

> 🧠 Why?
> Improves performance by reducing slow DOM operations.

 🔍 Example:

If a user types in an input field, React compares old vs new Virtual DOM and updates only the changed element.

---

 ✅ 3. JSX (JavaScript XML)

 🔹 What is it?

JSX allows us to write HTML in JavaScript.

 ✅ Example:

jsx
const name = "Ali";
const element = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;


> 🧠 Why?
> JSX is cleaner and more readable, and it lets you use JS inside HTML-like code.

---

 ✅ 4. Conditional Rendering

 🔹 What is it?

Show different UI based on conditions.

 ✅ Example:

jsx
function Greeting({ isLoggedIn }) {
  return isLoggedIn ? <h1>Welcome back!</h1> : <h1>Please log in</h1>;
}


> 🧠 Why?
> React gives full control to dynamically display content.

---

 ✅ 5. Unidirectional Data Flow

 🔹 What is it?

Data in React flows from parent → child (top to bottom).

You can’t directly send data back from child to parent without a callback.

 ✅ Example:

jsx
function Parent() {
  const name = "Ali";
  return <Child name={name} />;
}

function Child(props) {
  return <p>Hello, {props.name}</p>;
}


> 🧠 Why?
> It makes data flow predictable and easy to debug.

---

 ✅ 6. State Management

 🔹 What is it?

React lets components store and manage data (state) internally.

When state changes, the component automatically re-renders.

 ✅ Example:

jsx
import { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click Me</button>
    </>
  );
}


> 🧠 Why?
> React’s state makes components interactive and lets you build dynamic UIs.
