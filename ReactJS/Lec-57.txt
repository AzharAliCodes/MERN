 🔷 1. Virtual DOM

 ✅ What is it?

The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a lightweight copy of the real DOM (Document Object Model). React uses it to improve performance by minimizing direct manipulation of the browser's DOM.

---

 📌 How it works:

1. You write JSX.
2. React creates a virtual DOM from it.
3. When changes happen (e.g., button click), React:

    Creates a new Virtual DOM
    Compares it with the old Virtual DOM (diffing)
    Updates only the changed parts in the real DOM

---

 ✅ Benefits:

 Faster UI updates
 No full page reload
 Makes React apps feel smooth and responsive

---

 🔷 2. Reconciliation

 ✅ What is it?

Reconciliation is the process React uses to:

 Compare the old Virtual DOM and the new Virtual DOM
 Find differences (diffing)
 Update only the changed parts in the real DOM

---

 🧠 How it decides what to change:

 If an element type or key changes, it replaces the node
 If only props or state change, it updates that part only

---

 ✅ Example:

jsx
// First render
<div><h1>Hello</h1></div>

// After update
<div><h1>Hi</h1></div>


➡️ React only updates the text inside <h1> instead of reloading the whole page.

---

 🔷 3. What is a Key in React?

 ✅ Keys are unique identifiers used in lists of elements.

When rendering lists (like using .map()), you should give each element a unique key so React can:

 Identify which items changed, added, or removed
 Perform efficient reconciliation

---

 ✅ Syntax:

jsx
const items = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Orange'];

items.map((fruit, index) => (
  <li key={index}>{fruit}</li>
));


 ⚠️ Warning:

 Using index as a key is okay only if list order doesn't change
 Prefer using unique IDs if available

 🔷 4. React Fiber

 ✅ What is React Fiber?

React Fiber is the new architecture introduced in React 16 to handle rendering.

---

 📌 Why React Fiber was introduced:

 Improve performance
 Make React better at handling interruptible rendering
 Enable smooth animations and responsive UI

---

 ✅ Features of React Fiber:

| Feature                   | Explanation                                       |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Incremental rendering | Breaks work into units and spreads them over time |
| Interruptible work    | Pauses low-priority work to run urgent updates    |
| Prioritization        | Gives higher priority to important updates        |
| Concurrency support   | Allows multiple updates to happen simultaneously  |

---

 🧠 Think of Fiber as:

> A smart engine behind React that lets it juggle updates better, faster, and more smoothly — like multitasking.

| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Virtual DOM    | In-memory copy of real DOM, used for faster updates                     |
| Reconciliation | Process of comparing old/new VDOM and updating the real DOM accordingly |
| Key            | Unique identifier in list elements for efficient updates                |
| React Fiber    | New internal engine that enables smoother, prioritized rendering        |
